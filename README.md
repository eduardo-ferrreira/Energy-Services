Three projects were developed as part of the Energy Services course, encompassing exploratory data analyses and data preparation tools, machine learning methods for forecasting energy consumption, and interactive dashboards for presenting the results. These projects utilized important libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn (sklearn), and seaborn.

Project #1 utilized energy consumption data from Civil Building @ IST to develop a forecast model using various machine learning techniques.

Project #2 utilized the results from Project #1 to create a dashboard showcasing the forecasted energy consumption.

Project #3 utilized energy consumption data from China and several European countries sourced from various datasets. The objectives of this project were twofold: (1) to predict China's CO2 emissions from 2019 to 2021 under the assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic did not occur, and (2) to predict China's CO2 emissions from 2019 to 2021 under the same assumption while considering a scenario where China's energy production primarily originates from renewable sources.

Three projects developed in the Energy Services course, where it was developed explorive data analyses and data preparation tools, machine learning methods to forecast energy consuption and
interactive dashboards to present the results. Some important libraries like pandas, sklearn and seaborn were used.

Project #1 uses energy consuption data from Civil Building @ IST to develop an energy consuption forecast model using ML methods, with several techniques being used.
Project #2 uses the results from Project #1, with a dashboard being created to show the results.
Project #3 uses energy consuption data of China and some European countries from several sources to: 
(1) predict China's CO2 emissions from 2019 to 2021, wether the COVID-19 pandemic had not existed; 
(2) predict China's CO2 emissions from 2019 to 2021, wether the COVID-19 pandemic had not existed, and if China's energy production were mainly from renewable sources.
